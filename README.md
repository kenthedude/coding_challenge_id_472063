This is a project made to show both front end skills and backend skills.
## Required technologies used for this challenge

- MongoDB version: 8.0.11
- Node version: 24.3.0

## FAQ

#### What are the next steps?

- There are a few views that still needs rework, so that would be the first thing to do.
- There is still no testing with Jest, especially with the backend.
- Integrate Swagger so the backend has a better documentation.
- Make the Postman Collection public, so others can easily test.
- Pagination would be a nice to have.
- Also Github Actions.
